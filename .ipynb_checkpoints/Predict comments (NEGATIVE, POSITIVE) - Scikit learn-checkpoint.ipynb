I love the way the story displays how there is no \"just bouncing back\" from being sexually assaulted.  Mia showed us how those demons come for you every day and how sometimes they best you. I was so in the moment with Broken World and hurt with Mia because she was surrounded by people but so alone and I understood her feelings.  I found myself wishing I could give her some of my courage and strength or even just to be there for her.

      "This book was quite a disappointment for me: the blurb caught my attention but the execution was a far cry from what I was expecting.Darcie is a survivor coming from a totally messed up childhood, at the age of 14 Reggie rescues her becoming her older brother. She always refers to him as her &#34;knight in shining harmor&#34;.The problem is that Darcie is an annoying 17 yo bordering to flat-out stupid that passes her time in fight and suspensions from school. Suddenly she decides that she's always been in love with him, an goes on throwing tantrums nod being insufferable.Reggie is a far cry from a knight in shining harmor, more of a psychopath with anger issues and murdering tendencies.The story is quite unbelievable and most of the times it appears nothing more than a series of scenes without a real logical connection between them.Also the writing wasn't very good: too minimal without a real deepness to the characters and the situations that appear to be flat at best. Sometimes it stemmed to me that the author was more concerned in hurrying to the next scene than doing well the current one.\n",
